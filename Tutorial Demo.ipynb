    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this demo, I'll be showing you how to write some basic proofs using Pylogic. First, a brief description of Pylogic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pylogic is a proof assistant written entirely in Python. It uses structural pattern matching to check whether inference rules\n",
    "are correctly applied, in which case an inference can be derived.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not an automated theorem prover, and cannot prove most complex statements by itself. How to use it is to write out the proof\n",
    "steps as you would by hand, but using Pylogic methods instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pylogic is still in early development, and there are still many bugs to be fixed. However, the inference rules themselves are\n",
    "logically valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, if you encounter any errors or seemingly wrong outputs, try running all cells from the top again to ensure everything is initialized correctly. \n",
    "\n",
    "This demo might seem long, but it's not meant to be. There's a lot of explanatory text and code. Feel free to skip some parts if you are familiar with the concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to play around with the code, such as checking the `.inference_rules` attribute to see the list of inference rule methods a proposition or class supports. For each inference rule, if you call the `help` function on it, you should get a little (hopefully helpful but may not currently be)\n",
    "docstring explaining it.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example is shown in at the end of the demo.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pylogic\n",
    "There are two main types of objects in Pylogic: `Proposition`s and `Term`s. A `Proposition` represents a mathematical sentence that\n",
    "can be proven, or its negation can be proven. This is similar to saying the `Proposition` is true or false, but is slightly different.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Proposition` that is not proven is not necessarily False, we just have not shown if it (or its negation) is True.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Terms` are objects that can serve as arguments to `Proposition`s. A `Term` is something like a set, a number, a sequence, etc. For example,\n",
    "in the code\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x.is_in(S)\n",
    "```\n",
    "which represents a sentence like $x \\in S$ where $x$ is a number and $S$ is a set, $x$ and $S$ are `Term`s, and $x \\in S$ is a `Proposition`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, all the terms in a `Proposition` are visible as its arguments under the `.args` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Pylogic, there are `Variable`, `Constant`, `Set`, `Sequence`, and expressions like `Add`, `Mul`, etc representing different types of `Term`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proofs\n",
    "In a proof, you typically start with some assumptions and derive some conclusion. Let's first create a proposition. We can create an atomic\n",
    "proposition named P as follows"
