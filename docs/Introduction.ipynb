    "## Introduction to Pylogic\n",
    "\n",
    "Pylogic uses SymPy for some functionality. SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. Read its documentation [here](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Pylogic itself is a Python library for symbolic higher-order logic. It aims to be a proof-asistant for undergraduate-level mathematics. Currently, proofs can be written in Pylogic and checked for correctness. There are no extensive proof-search methods implemented yet, which means you must already know the proof you want to write.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Pylogic does _not_ do\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, Pylogic does not focus on:\n",
    "- Computer algebra systems (CAS)\n",
    "- Automated theorem proving (ATP)\n",
    "- Equation solving\n",
    "- Proof search\n",
    "- Mathematical visualizations\n",
    "- Optimization\n",
    "- Numerical computations\n",
    "- Optical character recognition (OCR)\n",
    "- Large-language models or Machine Learning in general\n",
    "- Typesetting\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these functionalities might be added in the future, but the current focus is on symbolic higher-order logic and proof-checking.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pylogic requires Python 3.11 or later to run.**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install pylogic using pip from Github:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install \"git+https://github.com/L-iet/pylogic.git\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To locally install, clone the repository and run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, clone the repository, create a virtual environment, and install the dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bash:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/L-iet/pylogic.git\n",
    "cd pylogic\n",
    "python -m venv venv\n",
    "source venv/bin/activate\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Windows Command Prompt:\n",
    "```cmd\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/L-iet/pylogic.git\n",
    "cd pylogic\n",
    "python -m venv venv\n",
    "venv\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importing Pylogic\n",
    "\n",
    "After installing, check if Pylogic is working by importing it. Open a Python interpreter or a Jupyter notebook and run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pylogic import *\n",
    "```\n",
